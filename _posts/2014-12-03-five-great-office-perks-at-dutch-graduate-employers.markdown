## [Coolblue](https://magnet.me/public/#!/organization/coolblue/about) - Have meetings in a ball pit

The last time the most of us were in a ball pit, we were still happy with a Happy Meal. Well, at Cool Blue they take important decisions while being submerged in blue, yellow, red and green balls and have meetings in an indoor garden house.

## [Coca-Cola Enterprises](https://magnet.me/company/coca-cola-enterprises/about) - Free coke 

BREAKING NEWS: free Coca-Cola at Coca-Cola!! (Likewise, we offer our employees free internships and jobs.) So, ok, it might not be surprising, but does that really matter when you’re thirsty? And if you’re done with Coke, you can always switch to Fanta, Nestea, Dr. Pepper or any of the other CCE-brands.

## [MN](https://magnet.me/company/mn/about) - Do squats in between spreadsheets 

If you’re done with Excel, at MN you can take the elevator downstairs and hit the gym (which comes with a personal trainer). After all: Anime Sana In Corpore Sano (ever wondered where the name ASICS came from?): a healthy mind in a healthy body.
