<p class="intro">Two important things you as a graduate are typically involved in are dating and finding a job. Whether or not you have made the comparison before, one thing is quite clear; the ugly truth is that both have quite a bit of similarities. Therefore being the perfect date, not only helps you in the dating world but can also help you land the job you’re applying for. Here’s why.</p>

**Nowadays the first steps in any new relationship, whether personal or professional, happen online. Often following the same stages.**

# Stage 1: First impression

Although we hate to admit it, we all judge a book by its cover. Whether it's while browsing through Magnet.me or flinging through Tinder, it's that first impression that captures your attention. Here are the three major components we base our judgments on when it comes to dating and finding a job.
 
## 1. Profile picture

Does the candidate present him or herself in a way that is attractive? The answer to this does not have to be based on looks, while especially when this comes to dating may play a dominant role, but on how they present themselves. The importance of a representative profile picture shouldn’t be underestimated; after all it’s the first thing people see of you!
 
## 2. 	How they write about themselves
 
Once your profile picture has been deemed acceptable, the next thing that is looked at is how you talk about yourself. Are you clearly over exaggerating your accomplishments and being too cliché? And yes we consider “I enjoy long walks on the beach” and “I have extensive experience” a bit unrealistic, especially if you are a first year bachelor student who’s never had a job other than babysitting.  
 
## 3. 	Are you a good match?
 
What we mean by a "good match" is not limited to liking the same movies or being each other’s “type” but also includes having goals that mesh well together. If you state that you want to work in investment banking but refuse to work long hours, you might want to re-evaluate your desired career path.
 
 
# Stage 2: The first face-to-face encounter
 
Everyone is familiar with that nervous feeling before a first-date or before an interview. As the conversation starts to flow (or doesn’t) and the ice is broken (or remains pretty solid), your expectations and first impressions are confirmed or denied. “Hmm their profile says they’re social but they clearly do not know how to have a conversation”. Or, “Wow they really weren’t lying when they said they were outgoing! He/she just couldn’t stop talking!”
 
 
Regardless of whether the outcome is positive or negative the first face-to-face encounter is always exciting, and when both parties have a positive attitude about the experience, the decision to “take the next step” can be made.
 
# Step 3: Taking the next step
 
I think we are all familiar with the phrase “Taking the next step” whether referring to dating or finding a job. Once both parties have decided that they are interested in building a future together this process begins. As rules are established and a you familiarize yourself with one another things develop . . .
 
# Step 4: Cutting things off
 
There comes a time, in some but not all relationships, where things just don’t work anymore; there is conflict, long hours are spent on things that just don’t seem to work out, and then it happens. . . The breakup.
 
No matter if you’re the employer breaking the bad news to an employee or about to break someone’s heart this situation is never fun. Getting fired and being dumped are two things that no one enjoys.
 
Thankfully as time passes, hearts heal and new jobs are found and after a long time all is forgotten. After all this you can finally move on only to start the entire process all over again, until you finally find that one person or company who gives you what you want.

Good news! Getting in touch with the perfect match has never been so easy. Nowadays you get invited, and within seconds you can decide whether a person on Tinder, or a company on Magnet.me, will have the opportunity to get to know you. So what are you waiting for? The perfect match is only one mouse click away. 

See who’ll invite you..
