**Take-away:** Try to come up with answers that are creative, but realistic. Even when the questions itselves might be a bit odd..
 
## 4. Transformers 3 

> “So it all depends on how you respond to my two next two words: Impress. Me.”

<small>► 1:37s - 2:55s</small>

**Take-away:** Be confident, even if you’re not sure how to respond. Remember that what you say (the content) only counts for 20% of the total impression you give.

## 3. The Company man  

Starring Ben Affleck as a former top sales executive who’s facing a not-so impressed recruiter in his search for a new job.

## 2. Step brothers

Why not wear a tuxedo and bring a mate to your job interview?

**Take-away:** Remember the interviewer’s name, and yes, it’s better to come alone.

## 1. The Pursuit of Happyness

This must be one of the most inspiring job interviews ever. Four suits vs Will Smith not wearing a shirt…

**Take-away:** Even when everything goes wrong before an interview: show up and go for it!
