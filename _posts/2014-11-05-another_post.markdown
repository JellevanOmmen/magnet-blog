Welcome to the first Magnet.me blog post. It's pretty awesome.

Your blog is the most important piece of your online marketing pie.

It's where your best messaging originates and where most of your prospective clients will land when they want to build a deeper relationship with you.

Not convinced? Here are 6 reasons that might change your mind:

1. Your blog is your platform for sharing your values, core messages and unique perspective. It’s a narrative that starts chain reactions. People who find value in your words will share them with their lists.

2. Your blog spreads your messages to a wider audience. Readers who follow you on Facebook, Twitter, Google + and Linked In will go to your blog for more in-depth content.

3. Your blog positions you as an expert. Each new post builds your credibility as an expert in your field. No other medium offers you this much free, unlimited space to communicate with readers.

4. Your blog is your home base; it’s the foundation of your online brand. Social media outlets are outposts to your online identity. Their purpose is to drive traffic to your website and your blog, i.e., Your Space. If you want to be known for your ideas, blogs are where to start.

5. Your Blog is where you begin to influence, persuade and move your prospects to act. It's where they begin to know, like and trust you.

6. Your blog is where you become recognized as a thought leader. It’s where you introduce your burgeoning ones and get a feel for what challenges your readers most.

So what are you waiting for? Why aren’t you blogging?
