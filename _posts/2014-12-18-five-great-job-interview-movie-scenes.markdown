Take-away: Try to come up with answers that are creative, but realistic, even when the questions themselves might be a bit odd..

## 2. Transformers 3 

“So it all depends on how you respond to my two next two words: Impress. Me.”

Take-away: Be confident, even if you’re not sure how to respond. Remember that what you say (the content) only counts for 20% of the total impression you give.

## 3. The Company man  

Starring Ben Affleck as a former top sales executive who’s facing a not-so-impressed recruiter in his search for a new job.

Take-away: Rejected? Don’t let frustration get the best of you! Discover which companies are interested in you. (hyperlink Magnet.me).

## 4. Step brothers

Why not wear a tuxedo and bring a mate to your job interview?

Take-away: Remember the interviewer’s name, and yes, it’s better to come alone.

## 5. The Pursuit of Happyness

This must be one of the most inspiring job interviews ever. Four suits vs Will Smith not even wearing a shirt…

Take-away: Even when everything goes wrong before an interview: show up and go for it!
