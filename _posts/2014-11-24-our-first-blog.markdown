On this blog, we will share our journey and the steps we take in order to enable people like you to grab the opportunities that lead to a great start of their career. In doing so we simultaneously empower every company to easily and effectively attract the right employees in order for them to grow their organisation. 

We will also present you with some useful tips how you can optimally use Magnet.me (which we happen to know a lot about) and naturally we’ll share our insights in the labour market with you. 

But let us start out this blog by telling something about our story and our philosophy. 

<!--more-->

We created Magnet.me out of our own experience with exploring the labour market: a market crowded with intermediaries, unpersonal career websites and aggressive recruitment agencies. It just didn’t (and doesn’t) work well - yet. As a graduate, you only got into contact with big firms with even bigger recruitment budgets, as attending a career fair, posting a vacancy on a career website or hiring someone through a recruitment agency is very expensive. Not something a startup or small- or medium enterprise would do. We also noticed that on social media we were only following the companies we already knew. __Result: you miss out on a lot of opportunities__. Not that that would be your fault: you simply didn’t know…. And that’s exactly the problem, right there. 

__We believe that everyone should be able to attract all relevant opportunities, regardless of a firm’s recruitment budget or size.__ That is why we stripped the recruitment process of all barriers (even the financial ones) and you automatically receive network requests of the companies that are interested in you, whether this is a multinational or a startups.

We are a young, dedicated and passionate team, that works hard every day to make an impact in people’s lives by providing them with opportunity and enabling them to land their dream job through creating an amazing product.  

Two years after launching Magnet.me, our team did not only grow from 3 to 27 people, but we also became the leading career exploration tool in the Netherlands with over half of all Dutch university graduates already having created an account on Magnet.me. Besides that, over 500 companies, from multinationals to startups, now use Magnet.me to get in touch with their future employees and interns. But we are not quite there yet. A lot of opportunities are still waiting to be unveiled to the right candidates. So you can still expect a lot from us. We will write about it here, so stay tuned.
