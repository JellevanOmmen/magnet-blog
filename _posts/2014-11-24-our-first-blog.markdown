How does it work? How do you guys make money? How come you look so handsome and cool? These are just a few of the questions we get every day from our users, friends, friend-users, newspapers, startupenthousiasts and others. Well, they are all excellent questions and we’d love to answer them, so we will do so. Right here. Right now. 

But let us first explain where you are now. This is our brand new blog page. Here, we will tell you about our adventures, but also about how you can optimally use Magnet.me, we will share our insights of the labour market, share stories and a bunch of other things we think are cool and we think you think are cool too (still following?). 

Now, first things first: we’ve talked enough about you, let’s talk about us. About how we got to the idea of changing the way candidates and employers interact, about our philosophy, about our mission. 

Ok, before we start to give you an insight into the mighty (and possibly evil) Magnet.me corporation, please note that you can read our whole story over here: https://magnet.me/student/#!/organization/magnet.me/about

So, we are 26 young guys and girls (note that nobody is older than Freek, who just turned 29 last september), committed to make the opportunities that are open, but not known to you, familiar to you. We want to empower you to connect with the companies you’d love. We believe in transparency. In the fact that recruitmentbudgets shouldn’t dertermine where you start your career. That is why Magnet.me is free to employers and no, we do not get a fee (not a single cent!) when you are hired through Magnet.me. 

If you must know: companies can choose a premium plan for a small monthly fee, but we never charge when this means a disadvantage for a candidate. After all: we founded Magnet.me as students, who believed in a labour market without (financial) boundries and we stick to that vision and the principle of putting your interests first, as if they were our own. Every. Single. Day.
